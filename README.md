#Schrödinger's Cat Meme Generator - HTML + JS

It's a simple meme generator built using a single HTML file that contains all the necessary code (including JavaScript) to run independently in the browser.

The basic idea is to make a single file where you can run a virtual Schrödinger experiment:  
Depending on the result, you might get a live cat. If not, you get a meme.

## Purpose

This repository is designed as a personal coding challenge and learning tool.  
Each commit showcases what can be achieved in a 2-hour work session.  
The more complex and feature-rich the result, the better.

## Features (v0.1) Sept 2025

-	[x] Original image embedded directly in the code
- [x] Add text to the top and bottom to create memes
- [x] Download the final meme as an image
-	[x] All-in-one HTML file (no external dependencies)
-	[x] API call to externally store the total number of runs and their outcomes
-	[x] ~~Ability to customize font style, size, and color~~ (developed but intentionally removed)
-	[x] API call to get a random "Live Cat" image (works but API limit reached) 
-	[ ] API call to AI LLM to suggest a random joke each time. The 2-hour session wrapped up with this feature added, but tweaking the end result messed with the text, which was too long to make the meme good enough.

## Project Structure

The project's just one file:

Hey, here's the link to the Schrodinger page: It's got HTML, embedded CSS, and JavaScript.
